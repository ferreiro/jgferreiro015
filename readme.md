## My personal website for 2015-2016.
Write text heeere.

### What I want to learn after I finish this project.
- Stylus css. Make the whole css with this preprocessor.
- Working on my writing skills (creating very clear and interesting texts about myself).
- Show my work in a attractive way.
- Using SVG (scalable vector graphics) for the logo and more things.
